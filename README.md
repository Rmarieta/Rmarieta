<h1>RaphaÃ«l MariÃ©tan</h1>

:student: Freshly graduated master student from the EPFL with strong interest and experience in signal processing, computer vision, Deep Learning, and Web development. I took part to multiple projects that involved building a complete Data Analysis pipeline; ranging from Data extraction, exploration and presentation, to extracting models and explaining them. Example of some personal projects : 

:page_facing_up: Master Thesis on <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/3DNeuronDeepReinfLearning'>Using Deep Reinforcement Learning to Segment and Extract the Spatial Connectivity of 3D Neurons</a>. 
- <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/LTS4'>Building and Interpretation of a Seizure Classifier from EEG Recordings Using Graph Signal Processing</a>.
- <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/NeuroDrosophila'>Implementation of a Computational Model of a Drosophila with Sensorimotor Functions</a>.

I also showcase multiple software engineering projects on my page, in which I display full-stack \(<a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/FullStackDashboard'>Financial Dashboard</a>\), frontend \(a <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/NFTMarketPlace'>NFT Markeplace</a>, a <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/linkedin'>LinkedIn Clone</a> and a <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/ReactDashboard'>Responsive Dashboard</a>\) and backend development interfaces \(such as a <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/JobListingSpringReact'>Job Listing</a> app, or an <a href='https://github.com/Rmarieta/EmployeeAngularSpring'>Employee Management</a> system\).
